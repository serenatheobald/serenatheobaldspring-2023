Head to the directory you created under `assignments/[LASTNAME]` and add your Containerfile there.

Checkout a new branch
```
git checkout [new-branch]
```

Create a Containerfile to package the script you wrote in the February 22nd assignment. Set the CMD of your container image to call your executable file.

```

CMD ./path/to/your/executable
...
```

This is what an example Containerfile looks like
```
FROM alpine
WORKDIR mydir
ADD joke.sh /mydir
RUN chmod +x /mydir/joke.sh
RUN apk add curl
CMD ./joke.sh
```
